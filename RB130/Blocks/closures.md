# WHat are closures?

Closures are a **programming concept** about saving a piece of code to execute it at a later time.

"Closure" come from the concept of "enclosing" or encapsulating(**?**) its surrounding variables, methods and objects (within a closure). They can later be referenced when the closure is executed.

Think about closures as undefined methods that can be passed around and executed.

There are 3 ways to work with closures in Ruby
1. Lambdas
2. `Proc` class
3. blocks
