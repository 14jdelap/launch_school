# 2. Put the loop in a method and run it. How is it similar and different?

# a. `inner` variables are still not available because they aren't returned
# b. Variable scope is now self-cointained and variables need to be passed
# c. `outer` variables are not reassigned or mutated because of the self-contained scope
# d. But inside the variable, the `outer` variables are different â€” they're the method's local variables



# 3. What will be displayed?

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga" # Does not mutate the object â€” but the method's local variable is reassgiend to "pumpkinrutabaga". Ie, it creates a new string object and binds it to the variable
  an_array_param << "rutabaga" # Mutates the object by appending
end
