1. Break down a problem into its subset of problems. I'll be wrong sometimes, not issue! Just restart.

2. Map out the flow of the program in a flowchart with subprocesses to encapsulate the more difficult parts.

3. Write pseudocode for a specific subprocess only. It'll likely be used for a method, so clearly identify its inputs and outputs.

4. Write and understand every line of code â€” don't copy and paste.
