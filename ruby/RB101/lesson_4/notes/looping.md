# Anatomy of loops

Loops have 4 basic elements: a looping function to execute the code repeatedly, a way to break or leave the loop, a counter and a way to retrieve the current value.

# Loops

A loop is composed of iterations. An iteration is each time a loop executes.

There are many type of loops: for, while, until, each, etc.

Blocks 

# counter

# break

`break` tells a loop to stop the execution of the iteration and leave the loop immediately.

# next

Tells the loop to skip the remainder of the current iteration and start the next one.
