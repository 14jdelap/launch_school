                  The participant who gets closest to 21 points in a hand wins the match.
                  From 2 to 10, each card is worth the same number of points.
                  The jack, queen, and king are each worth 10 points.
                  The ace is worth 1 point if the hand plus the ace equals more than 21, or 11 otherwise.
                  In each turn, you can choose to get a new card ("h" for hit) or play with your current cards ("s" for stay). If you stay, you can't get any cards later on.
