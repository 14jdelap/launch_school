# Description

The deck has 13 different card values (2 to ace) of one of 4 suits (diamond, ace, YYY, ZZZ).

Each card is worth the same number of points as its number. Jacks, queens, and kings are each worth 10 points.The ace is worth 11 points if the sum of all the cards (and the 11 point ace) is worth 21 or less. Otherwise, the ace is worth 1 point

At the start of a round a new, complete, deck is shuffled. 2 cards are dealt to both the player and the dealer (i.e., the computer). The player can see his 2 cards and a single card of the computer (assumption: the first card dealt to it).

Each player can choose one of 2 actions: hit (ask for an additional card) or stay (play with the current cards). If a player ends with more than 21 points they go bust and lose.

If both players stay before going bust, we compare the sum of points in their hands. The one with the most points wins, unless there's a tie.

At the end of the round, if there's a winner add 1 point. The first player who gets to 5 points wins the game.

At the end of the game, ask the player if he wants to continue or end the game.
