# Welcome!

These are (some) notes and code of what I learnt at Launch School.

I strongly recommend anyone who's seriously considering a career in software engineering to try Launch School out. I've had the luck to have had a very priviliged education â€” I and most people I know have gone to elite institutions.

Yet Launch School's clearly been the one of the (if not **the**) best educational experiences I've had in my life.
