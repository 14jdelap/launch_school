- Have an understanding of what URL encoding is and when it might be used

2 ways to encode a space: %20 or +
character between query params: &
to start a query param list: ?
to indicate KV: =

URL encoding is used to convert unsafe characters in a URL into a format that can be transmitted. THe ASCII character-set is what's available for a URL, so some characters need to be converted into a valid ASCII format. "URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits."

# URL versus URI

> URLs are "the most frequently used part of the general concept of a Uniform Resource Identifier or URI".
> According to RFC3986, a URI is "sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource", and a URL refers to:

> the subset of URIs that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network "location").

> We can take from this that a URL is a subset of URI that includes the network location of the resource. 

# Schemes versus protocols

> When looking at URL Components, we described the component that prepends the colon and two forward slashes at the start of a URL as the scheme.
The scheme identifies which protocol should be used to access the resource. Protocol in this sense refers to a family of protocols.
