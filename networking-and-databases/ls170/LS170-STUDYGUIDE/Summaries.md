# The Internet 

- The internet is a vast network of networks. It is comprised of both the network infrastructure itself (devices, routers, switches, cables, etc) and the protocols that enable that infrastructure to function.

- Protocols are systems of rules. Network protocols are systems of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data over a network.

- Different types of protocol are concerned with different aspects of network communication. It can be useful to think of these different protocols as operating at particular 'layers' of the network.

- Encapsulation is a means by which protocols at different network layers can work together.

- Encapsulation is implemented through the use of Protocol Data Units (PDUs). The PDU of a protocol at one layer, becomes the data payload of the PDU of a protocol at a lower layer.

- The physical network is the tangible infrastructure that transmits the electrical signals, light, and radio waves which carry network communications.

- Latency is a measure of delay. It indicates the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another.

- Bandwidth is a measure of capacity. It indicates the amount of data that can be transmitted in a set period of time.

-  Ethernet is a set of standards and protocols that enables communication between devices on a local network.

-  Ethernet uses a Protocol Data Unit called a Frame.

-  Ethernet uses MAC addressing to identify devices connected to the local network.

- The Internet Protocol (IP) is the predominant protocol used for inter-network communication.

- There are two versions of IP currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6.

- The Internet Protocol uses a system of addressing (IP Addressing) to direct data between one device and another across networks.

- IP uses a Protocol Data Unit called a Packet.


# Which of the following could be considered to be a network? Select all that apply.
- Multiple computers in an office connected together via a hub or switch.
- The internet.
- Multiple devices connected together via various hubs, switches, and a system of routers.
- Two computers connected to each other by an Ethernet cable.

# Which of the following statements are true in relation to network protocols? Select all that apply.
- Network protocols are systems of rules for controlling the transmission of data.
- Different protocols are concerned with different aspects of network communication.
- Different protocols are concerned with the same aspects of network communication, but in different ways or for particular use cases.

# Which of the following statements are true in relation to encapsulation in the context of network protocols? Select all that apply.
- Encapsulation is implemented through the use of Protocol Data Units (PDUs).
- Encapsulation creates separation between protocols operating at different network layers.

# Which of the following options describes latency?
- Latency is a measure of the amount of time it takes for data to get from one point to another via a network connection.

# Which of the following options describes bandwidth?
- Bandwidth is a measure of the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a specified time period.

# Which of the following statements are true in relation to Ethernet? Select all that apply.
- Ethernet framing adds logical structure to binary data.
- Addressing is a key aspect of Ethernet.
- The exact headers used in an Ethernet frame vary according to different Ethernet standards.

# Which of the following statements are true in relation to MAC addresses? Select all that apply.
- A MAC address is sometimes referred to as a physical address
- MAC addresses have a flat structure. This is one of the reasons the MAC addressing system doesn't scale well.
- A MAC address (usually) doesn't change, but is permanently associated with a particular device

# Which of the following statements are true in relation to the Internet Protocol (IP)? Select all that apply.
- The PDU used by the Internet Protocol is known as a packet.
- IP is used to route data between different networks.
- IP enables communication between devices, or hosts, but not between specific applications running on that device.
- Subnetting is actually enabled by IP addressing rather than being an alternative to it. It is the hierarchical structure of IP Addresses that allows networks to be logically split into subnets.

# Which of the following statements describe an IP address? Select all that apply.
- A unique address used to locate a device on the internet.
