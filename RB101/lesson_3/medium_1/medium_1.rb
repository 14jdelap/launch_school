=begin
Answer: no, because the elements within the hash were not mutated â€” they were reassigned within a copy of the object pointed by munsters.

WRONG: why?

Ruby passes the object id of an object to a method rather than the variable per se. It then stores these ids in their local variables (in this case, demo_hash).

However, it doesn't **copy** the object. Thus, reassigning its elements didn't mutate the hash but changed the elements within it.
