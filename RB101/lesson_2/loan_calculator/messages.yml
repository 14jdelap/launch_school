  purpose: |
                                I'll help you find what you should pay as monthly loan payments.
                                   Please take in mind that this only works for a single loan at a time.
                                   You'll need to give me a few numbers — please input them when I ask you for each.
  amount_loan:                  What's the total amount you owe in this loan? 
  incorrect_number:             You entered an incorrect number, please try again.
  annual_or_monthly: |
                                Now we need the interest on your loan. 
                                   Do you have it as annual ("A") or monthly ("M") interest?
  incorrect_annual_or_monthly: | 
                                We didn't get a valid option. 
                                   Please press "A" if you have an annual interest rate or an "M" if you have a monthly interest rate.
  interest_rate: |
                                What's your %{annual_or_monthly} interest rate? Use either
                                   - Percentages (e.g. 6%) or
                                   - Decimals (0.06) — note that entering 3 means 300%!
  duration_months:              How many months does your loan last?
  confirm_details: |
                                To make sure we got everything right, you told us that you have a:
                                   - Loan of $%{amount_loan}
                                   - %{interest_monthly} monthly interest rate, which is equivalent to a %{interest_annual} annual interest
                                   - %{duration_months} months of duration
                                   If something is wrong: press "N" to input the details again. 
                                   Otherwise press enter to calculate.
  monthly_payment:                Your monthly payment is $%{payment_monthly}.
  repeat?:                      Press "Y" to do another calculation.
                                   To exit the program press enter.
  goodbye:                      Goodbye, %{name}!
