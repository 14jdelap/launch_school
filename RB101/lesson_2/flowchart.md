# Logical problem-solving through flowcharts

Flowcharts help us map the logic of a program by sequentially mapping every interaction.

A good flowchart is valuable in that it helps us stress-test and identify how our program is supposed to work.

## Flowcharts as imperative or procedural programming

Imperative or procedural programming is about how a program operates.

This contrasts with declarative programming, which is about what the program should accomplish without specifying how it should do it.

Flwocharts are imperative/procedural because you need to break down the program step by step.

Inversely, methdos are an example of declarative programming â€” you call them without necessarily knowing what they'll exactly do.

## Components deepdive

- Start/Stop: where the program starts and stops
- Processing step: e.g. setting variables
- Input/Output: where he get a value from the user or output to them
- Decision: an expression that is evaluated to true/false and leads to different outcomes
  - Note that only **2 outcomes are possible from the decision component**
- Connector: used to signal a jump from one point of the flow chart to another
