# Problem

Take an array of strings and return a string that has concatenated all strings together

# Exercises

["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "Jose"].concatenation
=> "HimynameisJose"

# Data structures

The input is array and the output is string.

# Algorithms

Use the join.() method to concatenate the array elements into a single string. The method's default value concatenates without spaces, so we don't have to pass it an argument.

# Pseudo code

START

Create method concatenation(string)
  string.join

END

# Code

def concatenation(string)
  string.join
end
