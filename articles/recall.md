Launch School is more than learning how to program — it's also about learning how to learn.

But what's the best way to learn?

I recently produced an interview of Scott Young. He published the best-selling book *Ultralearning* (focused on self-directed learning projects) and has spent about 15 years writing about learning.

He stressed 2 ideas: spaced repetition and free recall.

You've probably heard about (and maybe implement) spaced repetition. In essence, it's about reviewing content spaced out through time.

So if you have 7 hours a week to study, it's much better to space the work across an hour a day than working 7 hours on a single day. Moreover, it's also about the importance of reviewing what you've already learnt. [You can find several systems online. For example, they recommend to review something within a week, then a month, then a year, etc to make sure you don't forget.]

But I want to discuss more in detail the more counterintuitive one — recall.
