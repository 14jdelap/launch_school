# Learn deep to learn fast

I've been asked a few times how I go through the curriculum quickly. My reply is seemingly paradoxical: you need to stick to the curriculum but learn deeper than the curriculum.

## Do not deviate

One of the open secrets of Launch School is that it's developed for a specific purpose: to launch a career in software development.

A recent Capstone grad in London got a non-entry level job with a salary that was near the top of his expectation. In contrast, a friend of his was aiming for entry-level jobs after a 1 year CS masters for non-CS majors at Imperial College.

Imperial is an exceptional university. The detail is that it focused on something else — on training people to learn computer science, not to land software engineering jobs. That's a byproduct, not the core objective.

So if the results of Core and Capstone give you confidence, you should optimize for learning the program. Go into rabbit holes at your peril.

## Learn deep to learn smooth

The flipside is that you should go deeper than the curriculum.

If you went through the *Learning how to Learn* course, you might remember that memories form through 3 conditions:
1. Focused attention
2. Understanding
3. Practice

There's a saying: *go slow to go smooth, go smooth to go fast*. If you don't understand something — if you only remember it — you're standing on fragile ground.

### When to go deeper

So when should you go deeper than the course material?

Launch School already does an exceptional job at balancing depth with focus — and there isn't a right answer to this. My personal heuristic has 2 parts:
1. Am I rote memorizing something?
2. Is that clearly connected to what we're learning?

If I reply to both affirmatively, than I'll consider going deeper.

For example, I haven't given much thought about how Ruby code translates to C — because we've never touched it in the course. Inversely, in RB130 I was uncomfortable accepting the magic of expressions like `[1, 2, 3].map(&.to_s)`. That's why I searched online for an explanation — and I don't think I'll now forget what's going on anytime soon.

### How to go deeper

There's 2 parts to this: asking questions and finding answers.

The first part is the trickiest: I've rote memorized a lot *without being conscious* I was doing so. The best advice I've read on this comes from Robert Caro, who was once told that "you'll never get where you want to be if you continue thinking with your fingers".

The program and PEDAC teaches us not to think with our fingers when we're programming. But you should also avoid thinking with your fingers when you're learning.

My approach is to make it harder for me to think with my fingers — by writing things down by hand. I do this when I'm reviewing a course with a blank sheet of paper because as I write down the key concepts it slows be down enough to think about how they go together and the potential blind spots I have in each.

Answering a question is the easier part. In my experience what's helped me find an answer to a question is a combination of:
- Asking a TA in the course forums
- Asking a peer
- Searching online

But be careful of how much time you spent chasing answers — the objective isn't to understand a programming detail, it's to became a professional software engineer.



## Why this matters

There's no right answer to any of this — and I'm sure there've been some moments where I've made the wrong decision about how deep to approach something.


A course provides you the means to learn — but learning is a very personal experience. Launch School provides the best means to learn I've found, but that's only part of the journey,

The perfect course doesn't exist — it can't exist, because the people who take it have different background and objectives. Launch School's gotten pretty close, but
