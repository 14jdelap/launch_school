Write a program that reads the content of a text file and then prints the longest sentence in the file based on number of words. Sentences may end with periods (.), exclamation points (!), or question marks (?). Any sequence of characters that are not spaces or sentence-ending characters should be treated as a word. You should also print the number of words in the longest sentence.

Example text â€” The longest sentence in the above text is the last sentence; it is 86 words long. (Note that each -- counts as a word.)

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that
war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as
a final resting place for those who here gave their lives
that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not
consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave
men, living and dead, who struggled here, have
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or
detract. The world will little note, nor long remember
what we say here, but it can never forget what they
did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated
here to the unfinished work which they who fought
here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for
us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us -- that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave
the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain
-- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth
of freedom -- and that government of the people, by
the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
earth.

Write a method that returns the number of Friday the 13ths in the year given by an argument. You may assume that the year is greater than 1752 (when the United Kingdom adopted the modern Gregorian Calendar) and that it will remain in use for the foreseeable future.

friday_13th(2015) == 3
friday_13th(1986) == 1
friday_13th(2019) == 2

A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number that is a multiple of 7, and whose digits occur exactly once each. So, for example, 49 is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd), 97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and 133 is not (the digit 3 appears twice).

Write a method that takes a single integer as an argument, and returns the next featured number that is greater than the argument. Issue an error message if there is no next featured number.

Examples:

Copy Code
featured(12) == 21
featured(20) == 21
featured(21) == 35
featured(997) == 1029
featured(1029) == 1043
featured(999_999) == 1_023_547
featured(999_999_987) == 1_023_456_987

featured(9_999_999_999) # -> There is no possible number that fulfills those requirements

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms available. It isn't an efficient algorithm, but it's a great exercise for student developers. In this exercise, you will write a method that does a bubble sort of an Array.

A bubble sort works by making multiple passes (iterations) through the Array. On each pass, each pair of consecutive elements is compared. If the first of the two elements is greater than the second, then the two elements are swapped. This process is repeated until a complete pass is made without performing any swaps; at that point, the Array is completely sorted.

We can stop iterating the first time we make a pass through the array without making any swaps; at that point, the entire Array is sorted.

For further information, including pseudo-code that demonstrates the algorithm as well as a minor optimization technique, see the Bubble Sort wikipedia page.

Write a method that takes an Array as an argument, and sorts that Array using the bubble sort algorithm as just described. Note that your sort will be "in-place"; that is, you will mutate the Array passed as an argument. You may assume that the Array contains at least 2 elements.

Examples

Copy Code
array = [5, 3]
bubble_sort!(array)
array == [3, 5]

array = [6, 2, 7, 1, 4]
bubble_sort!(array)
array == [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]

array = %w(Sue Pete Alice Tyler Rachel Kim Bonnie)
bubble_sort!(array)
array == %w(Alice Bonnie Kim Pete Rachel Sue Tyler)

Write a method that computes the difference between the square of the sum of the first n positive integers and the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers.

Examples:

Copy Code
sum_square_difference(3) == 22
   # -> (1 + 2 + 3)**2 - (1**2 + 2**2 + 3**2)
sum_square_difference(10) == 2640
sum_square_difference(1) == 0
sum_square_difference(100) == 25164150
