Database diagrams can consist of 3 levels of schema abstraction
1. Conceptual: high-level design to identify entities and their relationships
  - Tables and relationship between tables
  - Entity relationship model
2. Logical: attributes and data
  - List of attributes and data types (not specific to a database)
3. Physical: low-level database-specific design focused on implementation
  - All attributes of entities
  - Data types of entities
  - Rules of how entities relate to each other

Illustrating database diagram relationships:
- One to one relationship: looks like a line
- One to many relationship: looks like a bird's foot on one end (i.e., the entitiy of "many")
- Many to many relationships: looks like a bird's food on both ends
