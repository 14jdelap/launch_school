The process used by programmers to manage changes to their databases.

# What is Git?

Git keeps track of your databases and its changes. It thus allows teams to more safely work together and track changes.

## Local vs remote

"Local" git version mean that the git folder has been edited locally in a computer. "Remote" git refers to the distributed database accessible to everyone with access to the codebase.

# Git commands

## Git init

Git init *initializes* the '.git' repository. This means that within the folder it's currently at, it creates a directory with a series of files that will allow git to work in that folder.

Inversely, removing git involves deleting the '.git' directory in a folder.

IMPORTANT: do **not** nest git repos within each other.
