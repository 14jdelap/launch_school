# What is operator precedence?

It's the order in which Ruby evaluates operators. Operators with a higher precedence are prioritized by Ruby over those with a lesser precedence.
- Jargon: an operator with a higher preference **binds more tightly to its operands**

As in mathematics, **parentheses have the highest precedence in Ruby** and override all others.

When operator precedence is equal the expression is evaluated (i.e. order evaluation is) left to right.
- Exception: multiple `=` operators are *evaluated right to left*

# Order evaluation

What's the output of:
```ruby
def value(n)
  puts n
  n
end

puts value(3) + value(5) * value(7)
```
More specifically, what's evaluated first: the `value` methods or the `+` operations?

Since a **method invocation** like `value(3)` **is not a value**, the `+` operations can't be executed. This implies that the order evaluation is first for `value` and then for `+`.

## How Ruby evalues

### Arithmetic expressions

In an arithmetic expression Ruby

1. First evaluates everything that it can in a left-to-right order **without calling any operators**
2. It then invokes the arithmetic operator methods on the values based on precedence

### Right-to-left evaluation

This happens when there are multiple `=` operators (i.e., assignments or modifiers) in an expression.

For example: `puts x if x > 5  if x < 3` or `a = b = c = 3`

Note that neither are good practice â€” avoid!

Right-to-left evaluations can also happen due to short-circuiting with ternary operators and comparisons.

This explains the difference between these 2 code blocks:

Block #1: without short circuiting
```ruby
10 ? 3 / 0 : 1 + 2  # 10 ? evaluates to true and leads to a 0 division error
3 / 0 and false     # Zero division error because 3 / 0 comes before `false`
false or 3 / 0      # No short circuiting because `false` in || statements don't guarantee the result
```
Block #2: with short circuiting
```ruby
nil ? 3 / 0 : false # nil leads to false
false and 3 / 0     # false in && statements lead to short circuiting
true or 3 / 0       # true in || statements lead to short circuiting
```
### Blocks and precedence

Blocks have the lowest precedence of all operators. Yet there's a nuance: between `{}` and `do...end`, `{}` has a higher precedence.

Let's see it's implications. What's the difference between:

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]
p array.map do |num|
  num + 1
end
=> #<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:map>
```
And:
```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]
p array.map { |num| num + 1 }
=> [2, 3, 4]
```
You'd expect that both blocks would print `[2, 3, 4]`. They both involve i) an array object, ii) that invokes the `map` method and iii) that gets passed a block `num + 1`.

So why does the first block returns `#<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:map>` while the second one `[2, 3, 4]`?

It has to do with the difference in order precedence. The first expression is like saying `p array.map` and the second `p [2, 3, 4]`.

**What's the implication?**

A method binds more tightly to its argument than a method call with its `do...end` block.

But inversely, a method binds less tightly to its argument than a method call with its `{}` block.

This can be visualized as:

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]

p(array.map) do |num|
  num + 1                     # <Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:map>
end                           # => <Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:map>

p(array.map { |num| num + 1}) # [2, 3, 4]
                              # [2, 3, 4]
```

To correct this default behavior, we can extend p's parentheses to the end of the `do...end` block:
```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]

p(array.map do |num|
  num + 1                     # [2, 3, 4]
end)                          # => [2, 3, 4]
```
### What happens with the `do...end` block?

But if the first expression is `p array.map`, what happens with its block? As with every method that does not accept a block, `p` **ignores the block**. You can confirm this with:
```ruby
p do |num|
  num + 1
end
=> nil
```

In this code block, `p` lacks its argument.

This also implies that a block without method invocations does **not create a scope**.
