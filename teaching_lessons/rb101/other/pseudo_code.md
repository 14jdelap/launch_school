# What is pseudo code?

This is "fake" code written in English. It's a semi-formal approach that focuses on solving the problem rather than translating the solution into Ruby syntax.

# The 2 layer problem

Starting to program is tricky because we're doing 2 things simultaneously:
1. Breaking down a problem into a logical solution
2. Translating the logic into Ruby syntax

Pseudo code allows us to focus on only the first task until we're ready to translate that into Ruby. This implies we don't have to multitask between both problems.

# Formalizing pseudo code

A pitfall with pseudo code is that it's too lax: writting in English is very different from the precise logic needed in programming.

We can shorten that distance by using reserved keywords.

START: start of the program
SET: sets a variable to be used later
GET: get input from the user
PRINT: print a value to the screen
READ: retrieve a value from a variable
IF/ELSE IF/ELSE: conditional if statements
WHILE: while loops to show its logic
END: end of the program

# Approaching pseudo code

Unless you're working with very small programs, it might make sense to make small chunks of pseudo code, translate to Ruby and verify it works, and then work on the next chunks.

This approach also trains you to break down a larger problem into its parts, which is a useful problem solving skill in its own right.
