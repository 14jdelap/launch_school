## Key idea: string sorting
```ruby
arr = [['1', '8', '11'], ['2', '6', '13'], ['2', '12', '15'], ['1', '8', '9']]
arr.sort
# => [['1', '8', '9'], ['1', '8', '11'], ['2', '6', '13'], ['2', '12', '15']] => WRONG!
# => [['1', '8', '11'], ['1', '8', '9'], ['2', '12', '15'], ['2', '6', '13']]
```

Why does `['1', '8', '11']` come before `['1', '8', '9']`? The trick here is that the numbers as evaluated as strings. Thus, they're evaluated character by character. So when comparing their third element, it compares `"1"<=>"9"` rather than `11<=>9`.

To sort it "correctly", we need to transform the inputs into integers and then sort them.
```ruby
arr.sort_by do |sub_arr|
  sub_arr.map do |num|
    num.to_i
  end
end # => [['1', '8', '9'], ['1', '8', '11'], ['2', '6', '13'], ['2', '12', '15']]
```

Why are the elements strings and not integers? The trick is that we are passing to `sort_by` an array of integer elements, each of which is associated with a corresponding string element. The sorting comparison is done on the integers, but the result is on the strings.

This is another example of the same functionality:
```ruby
arr = %w(array fudge marriachi lucuma senor)
arr.sort_by { |word| word[1] }
# => ["marriachi", "senor", "array", "fudge", "lucuma"]
# NOTE: this is an edge case. "fudge" should be AFTER "lucuma"
```
What happened was that we passed as arguments the 2nd character of each string to be used as comparison, though the array that was returned was with the original strings.

However, if we want to make an inverse sort we'd need to use the 2 arguments used when `#sort` is passed a block.
```ruby
# Inverse sort using index 1 as the comparison
arr = %w(array fudge marriachi lucuma senor)
arr.sort { |a, b| b[1] <=> a[1] }
# => ["fudge", "lucuma", "array", "senor", "marriachi"]
```

```ruby
[[8, 13, 27], ['apple', 'banana', 'cantaloupe']].map do |arr|
  arr.select do |item|
    if item.to_s.to_i == item    # if it's an integer
      item > 13
    else
      item.size < 6
    end
  end
end
```
