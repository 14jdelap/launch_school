In the previous assignment we said that HTTP is the primary protocol used for communication on the Web. What does that mean exactly, and what is the web? The terms 'internet' and 'web' are often used interchangeably, but they are distinct and specific things.

As we've previously outlined, the internet is essentially a network of networks. It can be thought of as the infrastructure that enables inter-network communication, both in terms of the physical network and the lower-level protocols that control its use.

The World Wide Web, or web for short, is a service that can be accessed via the internet. In simple terms it is a vast information system comprised of resources which are navigable by means of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). HTTP is closely tied, both historically and functionally, to the web as we know it. It is the primary means by which applications interact with the resources which make up the web.


Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) was the means by which the resources in this system should be uniformly structured. This early version of HTML was intended for structuring text documents using headings, paragraphs, and lists. It was very basic, containing only 18 elements. The most revolutionary of these elements was the anchor elements <A>, which uses a href attribute to provide a link from one resource to another. We'll explore HTML in a lot more detail in a later course.

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), is a string of characters which identifies a particular resource. It is part of a system by which resources should be uniformly addressed on the Web. On the W3C website, the purpose of a URI is described in the following way:


Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the set of rules which provide uniformity to the way resources on the web are transferred between applications. In the next assignment we'll dive into HTTP and get a good understanding of how it works.

The web, and its various components, have evolved a lot since the early days. HTML and HTTP have both been through several iterations, and resources on the web are no longer limited to simple text documents but can include things such as images, video, audio files, dynamically generated content, and much more. We'll look at some of these changes in later assignments, lessons, and courses.
