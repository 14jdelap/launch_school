The HTTP protocol has been through several changes from its inception. The protocol started in its most simplified form returning only HTML pages. In 1991, the first document version HTTP/0.9 was released. In 1992, HTTP/1.0 was released with the ability to transmit different file types like CSS documents, videos, scripts and images. 1995 saw the release of HTTP/1.1, which introduced the ability to reuse established connections for subsequent requests, among a host of other features. Further improvements made to HTTP/1.1 in 1999 resulted in what we mostly see today. The evolution of HTTP doesn't stop there though. HTTP/2 is fast gaining traction, and the latest version, HTTP/3, is currently in development.
