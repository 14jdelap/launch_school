Communication protocols used in lower layers are unreliable. The network, up to and including the Internet Protocol, is an unreliable communication channel. (example: Ethernet Protocol and Internet Protocol check for corruption with checksum, but just discard the corrupted data/frames and don't deal with it).


> A major characteristic of the communication protocols that are primarily used to provide the functionality for the lower layers in our network system is that they are inherently unreliable. We've seen that protocols such as Ethernet and the Internet Protocol include checksum data as part of their header or trailer so that the data transported as frames and packets can be tested to ensure it hasn't become corrupt during its journey. If the data is corrupt however, these protocols simply discard it (dropping the frame or packet); there is no provision within these protocols for enabling the replacement of lost data. The possibility of losing data and it not being replaced means that the network up to and including the Internet Protocol is effectively an unreliable communication channel.
