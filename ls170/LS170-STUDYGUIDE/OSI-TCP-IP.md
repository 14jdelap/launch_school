The **OSI model** and the **Internet Protocol Suite** are two models for conceptualizing end-to-end processes for network communication. These two models both represent network communication protocols, but are broken down in differing ways: the Internet Protocol Suite is divided into four layesr based on the scope of communication within the layers, whereas the OSI model divides the layers based on the function that the layer provides.

> The top layer of the Internet Protocol Suite (Application) mostly maps to the top three layers of the OSI Model (Application, Presentation, Session).
> The second layer of the Internet Protocol Suite (Transport) mostly maps to the fourth layer of the OSI model (Transport)
> The third layer of the Internet Protocol Suite (Internet) mostly maps to the fifth layer of the OSI model (Network)
> The fourth layer of the Internet Protocol Suite (Link) mostly maps to the bottom two layers of the OSI model (Data Link and Physical)
