Because query strings are passed in through the URL, they are only used in HTTP GET requests. We'll talk about the different HTTP requests later in the book, but for now just know that whenever you type in a URL into the address bar of your browser, you're issuing HTTP GET requests. Most links also issue HTTP GET requests, though there are some minor exceptions.
